# Playing with tensorflow for fine-tuned classification

Currently following this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@linjunghsuan/create-a-simple-image-classifier-using-tensorflow-a7061635984a), which will allow us to train and add a new layer to inceptionnet-v3 (a spin off of google net). Planning on experimenting with several architectures and paramaters to see what will work well for fined tuned classificaiton of monkeys.
